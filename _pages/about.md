School of Computer Science at Peking University

# Bio

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Prof. Daqing Zhang. I am expected to graduate in June 2026, and I welcome inquiries regarding potential academic or industry positions. I received my B.S. degree from Peking University in 2021.

# Research Interests
My research interests lie in ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, and wireless sensing. Specifically, I leverage mmWave radar to accurately and non-invasively sense human activity and physiological signals. I have worked extensively on both micro-motion sensing (e.g., robust respiration and heartbeat monitoring in single- and multi-person scenarios) and macro-motion sensing (e.g., high-fidelity point cloud generation for fall detection and activity recognition). By addressing key challenges such as multipath interference, calibration, and scalability, my work advances algorithms and systems that transform raw radar signals into reliable, semantically meaningful information for real-world healthcare deployment.
