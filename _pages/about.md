School of Computer Science at Peking University

# Bio

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Prof. Daqing Zhang. I am expected to graduate in June 2026, and I welcome inquiries regarding potential academic or industry positions. I received my B.S. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2021.

# Research Interests
My research interests lie in ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, and wireless sensing. I specialize in leveraging mmWave radar for the accurate and non-invasive sensing of human activity and physiological signals, with extensive experience in both micro (respiration, heartbeat) and macro-motion (fall detection, activity recognition) analysis. Building on this foundation, my current work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and reason with the mmWave modality. I am also keenly interested in extending these advanced sensing capabilities to enhance perception in robotics and autonomous driving.
